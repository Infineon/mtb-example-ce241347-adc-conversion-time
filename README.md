# PSOC&trade; Control C3M/P8: ADC Group 0 conversion

This code example applies for PSOC&trade; Control C3M/P8 MCUs. It demonstrates converting all channels in an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) group and displaying the time required for the conversion. This code example is implemented on the ATOP ADC Group 0. 

The conversion is triggered by a timer, counter and PWM (TCPWM) configured as pulse-width modulation (PWM). On compare 0 of the PWM, it will trigger the conversion of all channels. Another TCPWM configured as a counter in one shot mode will be used for measuring the time taken for the conversion of the ADC channels.

After completing the conversion, the converted data will be read by the PPCA CPU 0. It also reads the counter value from the TCPWM configured as the counter and from that the conversion time will be calculated. The conversion time and the read data will be shared with the main CPU through the shared memory. The main CPU will send the results to the PC through the UART interface.

</details>


<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-ce241347-adc-conversion-time](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ce241347-adc-conversion-time)" application with the desired name "AdcConversion" configured for the *KIT_PSC3M8_EVK* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_PSC3M8_EVK --app-id mtb-example-ce241347-adc-conversion-time --user-app-name AdcConversion --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Design and implementation

This code example demonstrates the capabilities of the PSOC&trade; Control C3M/P8 PPCA ATOP ADC. This MCU has four different ADC groups and the first ADC Group 0 has eight single-ended direct-sampled channels. In this code example, inputs to all ADC channels in the Group 0 are converted and the time taken for that is measured using a TCPWM counter. All this information will be printed on the UART console. 

**Figure 2. Peripheral configuration**

![](images/peripheral-configuration.png)

**Figure 2** shows the peripheral configuration. All channels in the ADC Group 0 are grouped and the conversion is triggered by the TCPWM[0].Group[0].Channel[0], which is configured in PWM mode on its compare 0. The routing is done through EPU. EPU Combiner 60 and EPU processing unit T1 0 are used for that. Along with the start of the ADC conversion, the TCPWM[0].Group[0].Channel[1], which is configured as a counter will also be started. EPU Combiner 1 and EPU processing unit T1 0 is used for that.

On completion of the conversion of all ADC channels, the end of conversion signal will capture the TCPWM[0].Group[0].Channel[1] counter value, which is done through the EPU Combiner 12 and EPU processing unit T1 1.

After that the TCPWM[0].Group[0].Channel[0] will generate an interrupt on the PPCA CPU 0 on its terminal count. Inside the ISR, the ADC conversion results and the conversion time captured from the TCPWM[0].Group[0].Channel[1] counter will be read and processed. It then sends the data to the main CPU outside the PPCA for sending it to the PC over the debug UART. **Figure 3** shows the sequence.
